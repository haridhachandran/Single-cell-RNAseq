**🚀 Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline Using Seurat in R 🚀**

This script guides you through a typical single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workflow, leveraging the powerful Seurat package to extract meaningful biological insights from raw count data.


**Highlights:**

**•	🗂️ Data Import & Annotation:**
Load raw gene expression counts and annotate Ensembl gene IDs with human gene symbols 🧬 using org.Hs.eg.db.

**•	🧹 Quality Control (QC):**
Visualize and assess cell quality via violin plots for RNA features, counts, and mitochondrial gene content 🎯.

**•	⚙️ Normalization & Variable Features:**
Normalize raw counts to mitigate sequencing depth biases, then identify highly variable genes 🔍 to focus analysis on biologically meaningful signals.

**•	📉 Dimensionality Reduction:**
Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce data complexity and visualize principal components 🔢.

**•	🧩 Clustering & Visualization:**
Identify distinct cell clusters, explore marker genes for each cluster, and visualize them in 2D using UMAP projections 🌈.

**•	📊 Marker Gene Detection:**
Reach cluster-specific gene markers based on expression thresholds and log fold changes, saving results for downstream interpretation ✉️.

**•	🎨 Feature Plots & Violin Plots:**
Visualize expression patterns of genes of interest across cells and clusters for better understanding of cell identities 🎭
